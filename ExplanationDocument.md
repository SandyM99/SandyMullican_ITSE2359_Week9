In the Banking System program, exceptions were used effectively to manage error handling for invalid operations such as insufficient funds and negative deposits. Custom exception classes, **InsufficientFunds** and **NegativeDeposit**, were created to provide clear and specific error messages when these situations occur. By implementing a structured approach using `try-catch` blocks, the program can gracefully handle exceptions, allowing for informative feedback to the user without crashing. This ensures a robust user experience, making it clear when transactions cannot be processed due to invalid input.
